<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present COLLODI, a conditional generative pipeline for 3D assets. Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a non-textured meshes, and have long generation times. COLLODI builds upon multiple state of the art methods order to generate fully textured meshes in a matter of 2 minutes on a single A100 GPU.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>While there has been some novel advancements in text-to-3D in specific areas.  There has yet to be a fully end-to-end pipeline / model for creating fully textured 3D meshes in a reasonable amount of time. </p>
<h2>Method</h2>
By combining multiple state of the art methods into a single pipeline we demonstrate that COLLODI is capable of generating guidable 3D meshes from only text.
