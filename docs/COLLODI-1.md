<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present COLLODI, a conditional generative pipeline for 3D assets. Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a non-textured meshes, and have long generation times. COLLODI builds upon multiple state of the art methods order to generate fully textured meshes in a matter of 2 minutes on a single A100 GPU.</p>
